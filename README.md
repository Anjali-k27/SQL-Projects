# SQL Case Studies 

Welcome to data town :)

<h3> 1. Relevel case studies </h3>

This section of SQL Case Study uses data from mode.com website. It's free to use, you just have to sign in. They have a huge resource of dataset to practice. 

Steps I followed:

Login to mode.com                                          
Export the required dataset(by default .csv format)                           
Open your MySQL Workbench.                                     
Create a new database 'casestudies' using command 'create database casestudies'                  
Run the SQL command 'use casestudies' to work in the specific database                               
Import the .csv dataset downloaded from mode.com                                   
The .csv dataset will be imported in current database i.e., 'casestudies'                          
Run 'Select * from table_name' to view your imported dataset.

Once all above steps are performed successfully, jump right into deriving insights from your data. Yay, happy exploring :)

<h3> 2. Retail case studies </h3>

In this section, I will work on retail datasets and using SQL we will uncover the hidden gems of retail industry data. The dataset used in this section is taken from kaggle.
